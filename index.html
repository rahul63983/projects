    <p class="center">
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical information.

                <p class="center">
                    Twenty20 Internationals are the newest, shortest and fastest form of the game. This format of 20 overs per side has brought in new audiences since its advent in 2005 and also triggered new skill sets and innovations. A Twenty20 International match is usually competed in three hours and with huge hitting, skillful bowling and amazing fielding it has been hugely popular with fans right around the world. 

                 The ICC World Twenty20 is the premier international T20 tournament which started in 2007, and it has been hosted a further five times since then with the advent of the ICC Women's World Twenty20 being hosted alongside the men's event since 2009. However, the next edition, to be played in the Caribbean in 2018, it will be a standalone event for the first time.

                <h2 class="h-secondary center">Test Matches</h2>
                <p class="center">Test matches are the most traditional form of cricket, with the first official one being played by England & Australia at the MCG in 1877. They are played in traditional white cricket clothing (click here if you want to know the reason why) and with a red cricket ball.

                    A test match can last a maximum of 5 days, each being 90 overs in length. However, this has changed at various points in history. For example, at certain times in the history of cricket test matches were ‘timeless’ – meaning that the players would continue playing until a winner was determined, no matter how many days that took!
                    Both teams taking part in the game are allowed to bat twice, and there is no real limit on how long a batting innings can be. The winning team will need to dismiss the opposing team twice by taking 20 wickets in the match (10 in each innings), and they will also need to ensure that they’ve scored more runs than the opposition</p>

                <img src="one.jpg" alt="">
                <h2 class="h-secondary center">One Day Internationals (ODI’s)</h2>
                <p class="center">One day international matches were the second format to become widely accepted at international level, with the first one being played between England & Australia in 1971. This game was originally intended to be a test match, but seeing as the first 3 days of the game were washed out by bad weather, the decision was taken to turn the game into a one day game instead! The first ODI world cup was played in 1975, but it was Kerry Packer’s ‘World Series Cricket’ that really popularised the format in the late 1970’s and set one day internationals on the path they have followed to the present day.

                    These matches are played in coloured clothing like you can see in the photo below. They’re also played with a white cricket ball instead of the traditional red one. The white ball is used because it is a lot more visible against the background of the coloured clothing!

                    One day internationals are played (as you may have guessed) over the course of a single day. In these games, both teams are allowed to bat once for a maximum of 50 overs (300 balls). Once the batting innings has concluded for both teams, whichever team scored the most runs will win the match.</p>

       <h3>Rules of cricket matches</h3>
       <p><strong> Ways to score runs</strong> 
        The aim of the batsmen is to score runs. One of the main cricket rules is that for batsmen to score runs they must run to each other’s end of the pitch (from one end to the other). In doing this one run is scored. Cricket rules state they may run multiple runs per shot. As well as running they can also score runs by hitting boundaries. A boundary scores the batsmen either 4 or 6 runs. A four is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary after hitting the ground while a six is scored by hitting the ball past the boundary on the full (before it hits the ground). Cricket rules also state that once a 4 or 6 has been scored any runs physically ran by the batsman are null & void. They will only obtain the 4 or 6 runs.
        
        Other ways runs can be scored according to the cricket rules include no balls, wide balls, byes & leg byes. Cricket rules state that all runs scored by these methods are awarded to the batting team but not the individual batters.
        
        <strong> A “No Ball” can be declared for many reasons:</strong><br> If the bowler bowls the ball from the wrong place, the ball is declared dangerous (often happens when bowled at the batsmen’s body on the full), bounces more than twice or rolls before reaching the batsman or if fielders are standing in illegal positions. The batsman can hit a no ball and score runs off it but cannot be out from a no ball except if they are ran out, hit the ball twice, handle the ball or obstruct the field. The batsman gains any runs scored off the no ball for his shot while the team also gains one run for the no ball itself.<br>
       <strong> A “Wide Ball” will be declared if the umpire thinks the batsman did not have a reasonable opportunity to score off the delivery.</strong> However if the delivery is bowled over the batsmen’s head it will not be declared a wide but a no ball. Umpires are much stricter on wide deliveries in the shorter format of the game while being much more relaxed in test cricket. A wide delivery will add one run to the batting team and any runs scored by the batsman. The batsman is not able to get out off a wide delivery except if they are stumped, run out, handle the ball, hit their wicket or obstruct the field.<br>
       <strong> A “Bye” is where a ball that isn’t a no ball or wide passes the striking batsman and runs are scored without the batsman hitting the ball.</strong><br>
       <strong> A “Leg Bye” <\strong> is where runs are scored by hitting the batsman, but not the bat and the ball is not a no ball or wide. However no runs can be scored if the striking batsman didn’t attempt to play a shot or if he was avoiding the ball.</p>
        <br>

        <p>
        <strong> Ways Batsmen can be given out according to cricket rules</strong><br>
        There are a number of different ways a batsman can be given out in the game of cricket. When a bowler gets a batsman out it is said that the bowler gets a “wicket”. Following are the different ways a batsman can be given out according to the rules of cricket:
        <br>
       <strong>Bowled – </strong> 
       <div>
        Cricket rules state that if the ball is bowled and hits the striking batsman’s wickets the batsman is given out (as long as at least one bail is removed by the ball). It does not matter whether the ball has touched the batsman’s bat, gloves, body or any other part of the batsman. However the ball is not allowed to have touched another player or umpire before hitting the wickets.
        Caught – Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits the ball or touches the ball at all with his bat or hand/glove holding the bat then the batsman can be caught out. This is done by the fielders, wicket keeper or bowler catching the ball on the full (before it bounces). If this is done then cricket rules state the batsman is out.<br>
       <strong>Leg Before Wicket (LBW) –</strong> <br> If the ball is bowled and it hits the batsman first without the bat hitting it then an LBW decision is possible. However for the umpire to give this out he must first look at some of the factors stated in the cricket rules. The first thing the umpire need to decide is would the ball have hit the wickets if the batsman was not there. If his answer to this is yes and the ball was not pitched on the leg side of the wicket he can safely give the batsman out. However if the ball hits the batsman outside the line of off stump while he was attempting to play a stroke then he is not out.<br>
       <strong> Stumped – </strong> <br>A batsman can be given out according to cricket rules when the wicketkeeper puts down his wicket while he is out of his crease and not attempting a run (if he is attempting a run it would be a runout).<br>
       <strong>Run Out – </strong><br> Cricket rules state that a batsman is out if no part of his bat or body is grounded behind the popping crease while the ball is in play and the wicket is fairly put down by the fielding side.<br>
       <strong></strong>Hit Wicket – </strong><br>Cricket rules specify that if a batsman hits his wicket down with his bat or body after the bowler has entered his delivery stried and the ball is in play then he is out. The striking batsman is also out if he hits his wicket down while setting off for his first run.
       <strong>Handled The Ball – </strong><br>Cricket rules allow the batsman to be given out if he willingly handles the ball with the hand that is not touching the bat without the consent of the opposition.<br>
       <strong>Timed Out –</strong><br> An incoming batsman must be ready to face a ball or be at the non strikers end with his partner within three minutes of the outgoing batsman being dismissed. If this is not done the incoming batsman can be given out.<br>
       <strong> Hit The Ball Twice – </strong>
       <br>Cricket rules state that if a batsman hits a ball twice other than for the purpose of protecting his wicket or with consent from the opposition he is out.
       <strong>Obstructing The Field – </strong><br>A batsman is out if he willingly obstructs the opposition by word or action<br>
        There are many other cricket rules. However these are most of the basics and will get you well on your way to playing the game. Many of the more advanced rules & laws can be learned along the way and are not vital to general play.

            <p>
                International cricket matches are played between teams representing their nations, normally organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The main forms are Test matches, One-Day matches and Twenty20 matches.

                Most games are played as parts of "tours", when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation. The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup & ICC T20 World Cup.

            <p>The main international tournaments organised by the ICC include the ICC World Test Championship, the World Cup, the T20 World Cup, and the ICC Champions Trophy. The World Cup[24] is held every four years; it involves all the Test-playing nations and a number of teams advancing from the immediately preceding ICC World Cup Qualifier.[25] The T20 World Cup,[26] which is generally held every two years and, as in the latest competition, involves the ten full ICC members and six associate members who qualified through a qualifier competition, the ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier.[27] The ICC also organise ICC Champions Trophy,[28] previously known as the ICC Knockout Cup, a shorter tournament that was held every four years in between World Cups.

                A league competition for ODIs, the 2020–2023 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in 2020.</p>

World Cricket League
Main article: World Cricket League
The ICC WCL (known as the Pepsi ICC World Cricket League for sponsorship reasons) is a series of international one-day cricket tournaments for national teams without Test status, administered by the ICC.[43] All associate and affiliate members of the ICC are eligible to compete in the league system, which features a promotion and relegation structure between divisions. The league system has two main aims: to provide a qualification system for the World Cup that can be accessed by all associate and affiliate members, and as an opportunity for these sides to play international one-day matches against teams of similar standards.

The top division of the WCL is known as the ICC World Cricket League Championship.

Since the WCL started in 2007, the final matches in the WCL have formed the ICC World Cup Qualifier competition. This competition dates back to 1979.
